# ðŸ§  sRNA-MDD-Diagnostic

This repository implements the full analysis pipeline from our study:  
**"Circulating Small RNA Signature for Diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder"**,  
mainly including sRNA expression processing, statistical analysis, HAMD-17 severity prediction, and multi-objective model prioritization (MOMP)-based classifier design.

## Pipeline Summary

### 1. **Small RNA Preprocessing**
- Adapter trimming, quality filtering
- Mapping to known databases: miRBase, GtRNAdb, the rRNA database from NCBI, piRBase
- Normalization and filtering

### 2. **Differential Expression Analysis**
- Mannâ€“Whitney U test
- FDR correction (Benjamini-Hochberg)
- FC > 1.5 or < 0.67, adjusted p < 0.05

### 3. **Enrichment Analysis**
- Predicted target genes of sRNAs  
- GO enrichment analysis  
- KEGG pathway analysis  

### 4. **Correlation and HAMD Prediction**
- Spearman correlation with HAMD-17
- Elastic Net regression (cross-validated Î±, Î» selection)
- Bootstrap-based feature stability assessment

### 4. **MOMP framework**
- Classification tasks:
  - MDD vs. Control
  - MDD vs. BD
  - MDD severity stratification (HAMD-17 â‰¥ 17)
- 9 ML algorithms: Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, MLP, AdaBoost, Logistic Regression, GBDT
- Cross-validation and external validation 
- NSGA-III optimization
- Feature interpretation

### 5. **Feature Selection**
- Hierarchical clustering to reduce multicollinearity
- Feature gain + SHAP impact ranking
- Sequential forward selection + DeLong test

### 6. **RT-qPCR Validation**
- Diagnostic scoring for MDD

### 7. **Network and Pathway Analysis**
- miRanda + RNAhybrid for target prediction
- GO and KEGG enrichment
- Cytoscape network visualization
