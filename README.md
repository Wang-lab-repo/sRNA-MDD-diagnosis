Repository with scripts for all model training and analysis for paper "Circulating Small RNA signature for Diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder"

The fully pre-processed input data for training the models can be found in the supplementary files. For each cancer, the basic data we used is **'CANCER_DATA_TOP2_JOINED_BATCH_CORRECTED_CLEANED.tsv'** where CANCER is the name of the cancer type. This data is GEO datasets collected from top 2 platforms, intersecting genes taken, and batch correction applied.
